# Blackbird Starter Plugin

# Synopsis

This is a starter-plugin, a basis to build on. This plugin was developed using the [WordPress Settings API Tutorial](http://ottopress.com/2009/wordpress-settings-api-tutorial/). 
The plugin creates a new "Settings" admin page, and registers a few input fields. You can copy and paste to add more options based on the examples given. 

# Motivation

I developed this for my own purposes. I came across the **Otto Tutorial** in a web search. I wanted to get to know the code so I decided to create my own version of it. Something I can clone into a project and craft to my liking.

# Installation

1. Download the [Blackbird Starter Plugin zip file] (https://github.com/Herm71/blackbird-starter-plugin.git).
2. In your WordPress Dashboard, navigate to **Plugins**.
3. Click the **Add New** button at the top of the page.
4. Click the **Upload Plugin** button at the top of the screen.
5. Click **Choose File**
5. Navigate to the **blackbird-starter-plugin.zip** file you downloaded from [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and click **open**, then click **Install Now**.
6. Once the plugin is installed, click **Activate Plugin**.
7. After the plugin is installed, navigate to **Settings** in the dashboard and you will find a new sub-menu titled, **"Blackbird Custom Plugin Menu."**
